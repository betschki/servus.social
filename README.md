Find your top follower with one click. We'll slide into your DMs once a week.

## The idea

1. User clicks button to connect Instagram account
2. User grants necessary permissions
3. User gets first report sent in DM

## The report

In the MVP the report includes:

- #1 follower based on interactions in the last 7 days
- #1 liker based on interactions in the last 7 days
- #1 commenter based on interactions in the last 7 days
- own account is excluded (e.g. comments for #hashtags)

### Backlog for report

- biggest (negative) change (e.g. biggest drop off)
- dashboard to exclude other accounts (e.g. colleagues, friends, etc.)
